% StatisticEntity
% 	Represents a number of constraints for a given entity.
% 	An Entity is either an host or an touple of an subscriber,
% 	an publisher and an topic.

% 	-ueid
% 		Unique entity identifier. Identifies an unique Entity
% 		within the ROS network
\subsection{ConstraintHandler}
	- constraint[]: Constraint
		contains a list of all constraints

	- rated\_statistic: RatedStatistic
		contains all incoming rated statistic

	- global\_constraint\_level: int
		only constraints with an constraint\_level <= current\_constraint level get evaluated


	+ addConstraint(Constraint)
		adds an constraint to this list

	+ setStatistic(RatedStatistic)
		sets the Statistic to use. Should only be needed on initialisation

	+ evaluateConstraints()
		evaluates every constraint

	+ executeReactions()
		checks if there are any new reactions to do and executes them.

	- reactToConstraint(Constraint)
		executes an single Reaction and updates the attributes of the Constraint



\subsection{Constraint}
	- constraint: ConstraintItem
		first constraint in the chain of ConstraintItems.
	
	- true\_since: int
		epoch time in milliseconds since the constraint is true,
		if the constraint is not true it is 0
	
	- planned\_reaction: Reaction
		the reaction that should be executed if the constraint has been true longer than min\_reaction\_interval milliseconds
	
	- min\_reaction\_interval: int
		the minimum time needed in ms that the constraint needs to be true to execute the planned\_reaction

	- last\_reaction: int
		contains the epoch time in ms when the reaction corresponding to this constraint has been executed for the last time.
		is 0 if it has never been executed

	- reaction\_timeout: int
		minimum durotation in ms needed before an reaction can happen again

	- constraint\_level: int
		this constraint only gets evaluatet if the global constraint level is >= constraint\_level


	+evaluateConstraint(RatedStatistic)
		evaluates this constraint and sets the attributes according to the result of the evaluation



\subsection{ConstraintItem}
	Abstract description of a Constraint, can be an logical operation on constraints or an actual constraint

	+evaluateConstraint(RatedStatistic): boolean
		evaluates if this constraint, given the available RatedStatistic, is true. 



\subsection{ConstraintLeaf}
	Contains an actual constraint.

	-name: String
		contains the name of the statistic data

	-outcome: Outcome
		contains the outcome needed for this constraint to be true

	-seuid: String
		contains the unique identifier of the corresponding StatisticEntity


	+evaluateConstraint(RatedStatistic): boolean
		@return returns true if this constrain is true for the RatedStatistic



\subsection{ConstraintAnd}
	-constraint[2]: Constraint
		contains the two constraints to be evaluated with an logical and
	
	+evaluateConstraint(RatedStatistic): boolean
		returns true if the evaluation of both constains returns true



\subsection{ConstraintOr}
	-constraint[2]: Constraint
		contains the two constraints to be evaluated with an logical or
	
	+evaluateConstraint(RatedStatistic): boolean
		returns true if the evaluation of at least one constraint returns true



\subsection{ConstraintNot}
	-constraint: Constraint
		the constraint to be evaluated negated

	+evaluateConstraint(RatedStatistic): boolean
		returns true if the evaluation of the constraint returns false



\subsection{Outcome}
	Enum, represents all possible outcomes

	-high: data value is too high
	-low: data value is too low
	-unknown: data value is unknown
	-out\_of\_bounds: data value is either too high or too low
